Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.\n\nWe're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.\n\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728, while deals with a \ud83d\udd25 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a \ud83d\udce8. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\n\nEcho, Fire TV, and Kindle deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nAn Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room \u2014 and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.\n\nMore Amazon device and service deals\n\nAmazon services\n\nAudible Premium Plus \u2014 $5.95/month $14.95/month for four months (save $9/month; new customers only; get an additional $20 Audible credit)\n\nEcho Buds\n\nEcho smart displays\n\nEcho smart speakers\n\nFire tablets\n\nFire TVs\n\nNote: All Fire TVs come with a free 6-month subscription to MGM+ (a $35.94 value).\n\nFire TV streaming devices\n\neero\n\nKindles\n\nMiscellaneous Amazon devices\n\nApple deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNow that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.\n\nMore Apple deals\n\nAirPods\n\nMacBook\n\nMac\n\niPad\n\nApple Watch\n\nTV deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThis 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we're not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it's got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.\n\nMore TV deals\n\n43 to 55 inches\n\n65 inches\n\n75 to 85 inches\n\nLaptop deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nMacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air \u2014 the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.\n\nMore laptop deals\n\nTraditional laptops\n\n2-in-1 laptops\n\nChromebooks\n\nGaming laptops\n\nHeadphone and earbud deals\n\nWhy we like it\n\nNarrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you've confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose \u2014 but also that you want to stick to a budget. There's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max's sale price.\n\nMore headphone and earbud deals\n\nHeadphones\n\nEarbuds\n\nTablet deals\n\nGaming deals\n\nGaming headsets\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

        "body": "ETF provider Betashares, which manages $30 billion in funds, reached an agreement to acquire Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s superannuation business, in its first venture into the superannuation sector. Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group\u2019s shares hit an all-time low of 60\u00a2 after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63\u00a2. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60\u00a2 a share.\n\nMeanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown\n\nNovus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. \u201cConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.\u201d Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street\u2019s ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent.\n\nLoading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It\u2019s up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That\u2019s concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession.\n\nBesides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.\n\nOn Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China\u2019s economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1 per cent.\n\nCrude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71\u00a2 to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67\u00a2 to $US93.96 per barrel. Tweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cThe Senate committees have the power to summons witnesses within Australia but have no enforceable powers for witnesses who are overseas,\u201d said Senator Bridget McKenzie as former Qantas boss Alan Joyce chose not to front the Senate select committee into the federal government\u2019s decision to reject extra flights from Qatar Airways due to \u201cpersonal commitments\u201d."

        "body": "A worker sorts out parcels in the outbound dock at the Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale, California, on Aug. 31, 2021. Watchara Phomicinda | MediaNews Group | The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images\n\nIt was late in the day on Oct. 27, 2021, when Fred Ruckel received the dreaded automated email from Amazon . Amazon\u2019s software had detected that Ruckel\u2019s popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day. \u201cBelow is a list of product(s) in your catalog that are not currently eligible to be the Featured Offer because they are not priced competitively compared to prices for those products from retailers outside Amazon,\u201d according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 \u2013 less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter.\n\nFred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats. Fred Ruckel\n\nNearly three years later, Ruckel\u2019s experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that\u2019s led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an \u201canti-discounting strategy\u201d and a \u201cmassive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices\u201d to stifle competition. The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to sellers\u2019 businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an \u201cartificial price floor everywhere,\u201d according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer \u201ccompetitive prices,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren\u2019t competitive,\u201d Zapolsky said. \u201cJust like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced.\u201d Zapolsky argued the FTC\u2019s lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, \u201ca perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong overdue\u201d lawsuit\n\nOn Amazon\u2019s own forum for merchants, called Seller Central, several users cheered on the FTC and said they hoped it would result in changes to the company\u2019s business practices. Amazon\u2019s tense relationship with merchants has been well-chronicled over the years, with sellers expressing a range of grievances over issues like rising fees, an arcane suspensions process, and heightened competition on the marketplace from all sides, including the e-commerce giant. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, Amazon deserves it,\u201d one person commented, adding, \u201cMore should be coming on the way.\u201d Amazon in recent years made the forum anonymous, but users must have a seller account in order to post. Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, \u201cAs your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.\u201d One user called it \u201cBS verbiage,\u201d adding, \u201cBusinesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?\u201d Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as \u201cbeing up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.\u201d The seller went on to describe the experience as a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d \u201cIt's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.\u201d Still, others commented that the FTC\u2019s complaint is misguided. \u201cSelling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nSeller skepticism\n\nEven sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better. Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was \u201csurprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\n\u201cI have over the years been very critical of Amazon,\u201d Needham told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep because of some of the things that they have done. And the issues that they brought up, while they are interesting, they haven\u2019t created me a lot of pain.\u201d Needham said he was particularly puzzled by the inclusion of the claims that Amazon is coercive in the way it encourages sellers to use its fulfillment service, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Needham said many sellers \u201clove FBA\u201d because of its compelling value in terms of the price and promise to deliver two-day shipping. For many, using FBA doesn\u2019t feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,\u201d Needham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if this would actually change that.\u201d Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. With FBA, he said, he can ship an item into one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses for $7.49 per package, while shipping it himself through a traditional carrier would cost him about $12. \u201cI don\u2019t have to have my own warehouse,\u201d said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. \u201cI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.\u201d He also disputed the FTC\u2019s claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. \u201cWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,\u201d Moller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.\u201d Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic. At that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly\u2026 But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.\u201d He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he\u2019s seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,\u201d Needham said. \u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn\u2019t make the marketplace better for sellers.\"\n\nConcerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees\n\nMany sellers have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon\u2019s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon\u2019s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled \u201c24 anxious hours\u201d in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.\n\nMolson Hart, CEO of Viahart, an educational toy company that sells on Amazon.

        "body": "Christmas Day isn't just for the NBA, as the NFL is set to air an exciting triple-header featuring fierce division clashes and a highly anticipated matchup we could see again on Super Bowl Sunday. Here are the top players and storylines to monitor for Monday's slate.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) | 1 p.m. ET\n\nNew chapter in Patrick Mahomes-Maxx Crosby rivalry: This hasn't been as much of a rivalry between the teams as of late, with Kansas City holding a 10-1 record over the Raiders since Mahomes became its starting quarterback. Yet it has sparked an exciting feud between the two-time Super Bowl MVP and the two-time Pro Bowler Crosby, who has five sacks in nine career games against the Chiefs.\n\nMahomes and Crosby might not like facing one another, though it's clear there's mutual respect between the two, which only makes their rivalry more intriguing to watch.\n\nCan Raiders QB Aidan O\u2019Connell earn next season\u2019s starting job?: After leading the offense on seven touchdown scoring drives in last week's 63-21 win over the Chargers, the rookie fourth-rounder aims to further establish himself as a serious contender for Las Vegas' starting job next season. Despite the encouraging performance, O'Connell has been inconsistent across six games as the full-time starter, throwing for 1,300 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions.\n\nHowever, a stellar showing against the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense (202.5 yards per game allowed) would benefit his bid to be the starter in 2024.\n\nChiefs TE Travis Kelce: Yes, his girlfriend will be in town for the holiday. Kelce is averaging 89.6 yards per game with global popstar Taylor Swift in attendance this season but is coming off his worst outing in her presence, catching five passes for 28 yards.\n\nEven so, Kelce's 81.3 average receiving yards per game against the Raiders since 2019 suggests the All-Pro tight end is in line for a productive outing and could potentially snap his four-game scoring drought.\n\nNew York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) | 4:30 p.m. ET\n\nWill the Eagles defense shake off the rust?: Appointing Matt Patricia as defensive play-caller didn't change much for the Eagles, whose defense has given up the third-most points in the NFL over their current three-game losing streak (95). Although the unit has reached its lowest point, there are reasons to be optimistic about Monday's matchup.\n\nNew York ranks 31st among teams in points and yards per game this season and has surrendered a staggering 76 sacks, the third-most in a single season in NFL history. Not to mention, the annual trip to Philadelphia has essentially been a scheduled loss for the Giants, with their last win at Lincoln Financial Field coming in 2013.\n\nCan QB Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense finally bounce back?: Philadelphia's defense isn't the only unit that needs to rebound, as the offense has struggled mightily over the last three games, with Hurts' ineffectiveness playing a significant role. After averaging the third-most points in the NFL over the first 11 games (28.2), the Eagles have scored four offensive touchdowns during their current skid, three of which came via the \"tush push.\"\n\nThe Eagles may have difficulty throwing against a solid Giants pass defense, though they could alleviate some of their offensive woes by running the ball efficiently. New York gives up 131.6 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.\n\nDoes Giants QB Tommy DeVito have any magic left?: The Giants may have a terrible offense, but this unit has operated at its best under DeVito, an undrafted rookie and native of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\n\nDeVito has thrown for 858 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in five games since being named New York's starting quarterback, posting the 13th-highest passer rating in the NFL during that stretch (97.3).\n\nBaltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3) | 8:15 p.m. ET\n\nPotential Super Bowl sneak peek and MVP implications: Easily the most hyped game of the week, with the top seed in each respective conference squaring off in what could be a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview as well as the decisive clash for the MVP Award.\n\nAccording to oddschecker, 49ers QB Brock Purdy is listed as the heavy favorite to be named league MVP (-230), while Baltimore signal-caller Lamar Jackson holds the second-shortest odds (+525).\n\nPurdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, has seen his career unfold as if it were a fairy tale that just keeps getting more remarkable. The 23-year-old ranks first in the NFL in QBR (76) and touchdown passes (29) while ranking third in passing yards (3,795), all of which are especially impressive considering he's coming off offseason elbow surgery.\n\nJackson might not be posting the ridiculous numbers he did during his 2019 MVP campaign, but the adjustment in his play style in his first season under OC Todd Monken has led to sustainable, winning football. Nevertheless, Baltimore needs an upset win for Jackson to capture another MVP Award, as he has thrown for 3,105 yards and 17 touchdowns while adding 741 yards on the ground with five scores this season.\n\n49ers RB Christian McCaffrey: If Purdy wasn't playing at such a high level \u2014 and the MVP wasn't a quarterback-driven award \u2014 it'd be difficult to argue against McCaffrey taking home the honors. McCaffrey, who seems poised to win the Offensive Player of the Year Award, leads the NFL in rushing (1,292 yards) and total yards per game (128.6) this season and is tied for first in touchdowns (20).\n\nRavens TE Isaiah Likely thriving in the starting role: The Ravens offense hasn't lost a step since losing one of the team's top weapons in tight end Mark Andrews (ankle) in Week 11, largely due to Likely's emergence.\n\nThe second-year tight end has averaged 64.3 yards over his last three games, which is particularly noteworthy since Andrews averaged 54.4 yards per game before sustaining his injury.\n\nShould we expect a defensive battle?: While both teams boast offenses that rank in the top five in yardage and scoring, this may not turn into a shootout. The Ravens defense has allowed the fewest points per game this season (16.1) and second-fewest total yards (4,030), while San Francisco's unit ranks second in points (16.7) and 10th in yardage (310 per game).\n\nThe 49ers defense might be slightly inferior statistically, but it could have more of an impact in this matchup. San Francisco has racked up an NFL-leading 25 turnovers and has given up the second-fewest rushing yards (1,252), which should help slow down the team with the league's most effective running game."

        "body": "The Lions just needed to get themselves back in the win column after a blowout loss in Baltimore, and they did just that in front of their home fans on Monday night.\n\nDetroit rolled to a 26-14 victory over the Raiders in a game that felt much more one-sided than the score indicates.\n\nThe Lions thoroughly outplayed the Raiders, out-gaining Las Vegas by 329 yards, but critical mistakes by Detroit left points on the board. The offense struggled to turn red zone opportunities into touchdowns in the first half, and two turnovers deep in Raiders territory -- including a pick-six by Jared Goff -- kept Las Vegas in the game in the second half.\n\nMORE: What to know about Lions' retro 'Honolulu blue' helmets\n\nNonetheless, the Lions' defense dominated. The Raiders were abysmal on the offensive side of the ball, outside of a second-quarter touchdown drive led by Josh Jacobs. Jimmy Garoppolo completed just 10 passes, badly missing a wide-open Davante Adams on multiple occasions.\n\nAdams was seen slamming his helmet down on the sideline in the fourth quarter, and it's tough to blame the star receiver after an 11-yard performance that could have been exponentially better with better quarterback play.\n\nThe story of the night was Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, who finally broke through after entering the season with sky-high expectations. Tasked with leading the backfield in David Montgomery's absence, Gibbs exploded for 189 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in the win. It was the first 100-yard rushing performance of his career.\n\nMeanwhile, Amon-Ra St. Brown notched his third consecutive 100-yard game despite entering Monday as questionable with an illness.\n\nMORE: Why Davante Adams is unlikely to be traded before deadline\n\nThe Lions enter their bye in sole possession of the No. 2 seed in the NFC, while the Raiders drop their second consecutive game against an NFC North opponent and have what might be a must-win game against the Giants in Week 9 if they want any chance to linger in the AFC playoff race.\n\nThe Sporting News tracked live updates and highlights throughout the \"Monday Night Football\" matchup between the Raiders and Lions. Check out all of the key moments you might have missed.\n\nRaiders vs. Lions final score\n\n1 2 3 4 Final Raiders 0 7 7 0 14 Lions 3 13 7 3 26\n\nRaiders vs. Lions results, highlights from 'Monday Night Football'\n\n(All times Eastern)\n\nFinal: Lions 26, Raiders 14\n\n11:15 p.m. \u2014 That'll do it! The Lions bounce back and move to 6-2 with the win over Las Vegas. Detroit left points on the board, but the Raiders were thoroughly outplayed in this one.\n\n11:09 p.m. \u2014 The Lions get the ball back and will try to ice the game at this point.\n\n11:08 p.m. \u2014 Adding insult to injury, Garoppolo is sacked for the sixth time tonight. It's 4th & 17.\n\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 Davante Adams has had his way with Cameron Sutton at times tonight, and Garoppolo has just not made the throw each time. It happens again here on what would've been a game-changing play. Garoppolo has had a brutal night.\n\n11:04 p.m. \u2014 Riley Patterson missed a 26-yard field goal attempt after making his first four attempts tonight. Strange. The Lions can't come away with points on that drive.\n\n11:01 p.m. \u2014 What would've been a Reynolds touchdown is erased by a holding penalty. That does give the Lions a chance to erase some more time on the clock, though.\n\n11:00 p.m. \u2014 Craig Reynolds, up to 66 yards, has the Lions on the verge of the end zone.\n\n10:58 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo is sacked AGAIN. It's Anzalone for the second time on the drive, and that sends the ball right back to the Lions.\n\n10:56 p.m. \u2014 Now the Lions sack Garoppolo on back-to-back plays as Alex Anzalone and Alim McNeill come in to send the Raiders to 3rd & 28.\n\n10:53 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo hits Jakobi Meyers for a big 19 yards to give the Raiders something to work with.\n\n10:51 p.m. \u2014 The Garoppolo-to-Adams connection is just not working tonight. Adams was all by himself downfield, and Garoppolo throws it well out of bounds.\n\nLions 26, Raiders 14\n\n10:46 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 52 yards? No problem for Patterson, who extends the Lions' lead to 12.\n\n10:45 p.m. \u2014 Kalif Raymond was set up for a big play, but Goff's throw was just a bit behind him. That will get Riley Patterson on the field for a 52-yard field goal try.\n\n10:43 p.m. \u2014 Goff gets pushed forward on 4th & 1 to keep the Lions' drive alive. They're into Raiders territory, trying to ice this game.\n\n10:36 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs is just wearing down this Raiders defense for chunks of yards. He's up to 179 scrimmage yards and has the Lions moving down the field again.\n\nEnd of third quarter: Lions 23, Raiders 14\n\n10:32 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs turns what looked like little or no gain into a first down. He has 126 yards on the ground.\n\n10:31 p.m. \u2014 Alim McNeill sacks Garoppolo for an 8-yard loss, ending Las Vegas' drive. Aside from the second quarter drive dominated by Jacobs, the Raiders' offense has shown nothing tonight. Garoppolo has just 62 yards through nearly three quarters.\n\n10:28 p.m. \u2014 Michael Mayer gets the Raiders' drive started with a big 19-yard gain. That's the rookie's first catch of the night.\n\nLions 23, Raiders 14\n\n10:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! It's the rookie's night. He takes off for a 27-yard touchdown with his blazing speed and has 149 scrimmage yards on the night. More importantly, he gives the Lions a two-possession lead.\n\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 A pass interference call gives the Lions 18 yards and takes them well into Raiders territory after starting the drive with strong field position.\n\n10:18 p.m. \u2014 The Lions quickly get the Raiders off the field, and a bad drop by Davante Adams on third down is the culprit. The throw was a bit low, but Adams still had it in his grasp for a second. Las Vegas will punt.\n\n10:16 p.m. \u2014 It was hard to find a conclusive angle of what happened there, but Lions fans are making it known they think Reynolds was down. It doesn't matter. It's Raiders ball with a chance for Las Vegas to take the lead.\n\n10:13 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 For now, the Raiders force a fumble by Reynolds and instantly end the Lions' drive. Maxx Crosby ripped it right out of his arms. Was he down? That's what officials are taking a closer look at.\n\n10:11 p.m. \u2014 Another first down by Gibbs, who has 116 scrimmage yards, and the Lions have 1st & Goal.\n\n10:09 p.m. \u2014 Officials come out to measure whether Craig Reynolds got a first down...and he did. On the next play, Reynolds catches a pass from Goff for 12 yards. The Lions are in business on the verge of the red zone.\n\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 The Lions have gotten over midfield with two early first downs as they try to steal the momentum back. St. Brown is up to 108 yards on the night.\n\nLions 16, Raiders 14\n\n10:01 p.m. PICK-SIX \u2014 Marcus Peters picks off Goff and runs it 74 yards back for the touchdown! Amon-Ra St. Brown didn't have his eye on the throw from Goff, but Peters did. The Raiders are right back in this game.\n\n10:00 p.m. \u2014 There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! The rookie breaks tackles for a bruising 24-yard run. He's up to 97 scrimmage yards tonight.\n\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 Julian Okwara sacks Garoppolo on third down, forcing a Raiders punt. The Lions didn't want to let Las Vegas build any momentum to start the half, and mission accomplished.\n\n9:55 p.m. \u2014 It's quickly 3rd & 9 to start this third quarter after Davante Adams unsuccessfully looks for a pass interference call.\n\nEnd of first half: Lions 16, Raiders 7\n\n9:39 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders run one play but elect to go to the half. They'll start the second half with the ball and could use at least some points on that drive if they want to stay in this game.\n\nLions 16, Raiders 7\n\n9:36 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 LaPorta's great rookie season rolls on! The rookie picks up his fourth touchdown of the season and extends the Lions' lead. Detroit found success running the ball early, but that drive featured nice work from Goff. 16-7. Lions.\n\n9:35 p.m. \u2014 LaPorta picks up a first down for the Lions, and now Dan Campbell is going to start using his timeouts with 31 seconds left in the half. Detroit is at the Raiders' 18-yard line.\n\n9:33 p.m. \u2014 St. Brown picks up another first down for the Lions as they enter field goal range again. St. Brown is up to 94 yards in the first half after entering the day listed as questionable.\n\n9:30 p.m. \u2014 What would've been a horsecollar penalty on a nice Gibbs run is offset by a holding call. The fans don't like it.\n\n9:26 p.m. \u2014 There's a welcomed sight for Lions fans: Goff hits Jameson Williams for a 22-yard gain. Williams was held without a catch despite six targets in Baltimore last week.\n\n9:25 p.m. \u2014 Crosby is doing so much more than just getting to the quarterback tonight. He wraps up Gibbs, the third time tonight he's had an explosive play on a ball-carrier.\n\n9:21 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 That was a statement drive by the Raiders. Jacobs looked like the dominant runner he was last season and takes it in himself for the game's first touchdown.\n\n9:20 p.m. \u2014 Davante Adams doesn't have a single catch tonight, but Jacobs has 12 touches. Right now, it's starting to work. The Raiders are set up with 1st & Goal.\n\n9:19 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders are quickly into the red zone after another nice gain for Josh Jacobs.\n\n9:17 p.m. \u2014 Las Vegas' offense is moving much smoother now as Austin Hooper picks up another first down. Hooper has two catches on this drive.\n\n9:15 p.m. \u2014 It's back-to-back first downs for the Raiders, with the help of a 15-yard penalty on Aidan Hutchinson for a low block.\n\nLions 9, Raiders 0\n\n9:11 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Lions' drive fizzles almost instantly, so it's back to Riley Patterson's leg for another field goal. Detroit leads, 9-0.\n\n9:09 p.m. \u2014 Momentum swings abound. St. Brown comes right back with a 24-yard catch to make up the lost yardage and much more.\n\n9:08 p.m. \u2014 Maxx Crosby blows up another play, this time dropping Jameson Williams for a loss of six.\n\n9:06 p.m. \u2014 Big play alert! Goff hits an open Amon-Ra St. Brown, who goes 44 yards to breathe life into the Lions' offense.\n\n9:03 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders' offense continues to have nothing in the tank. Las Vegas gains four yards and is forced to punt after less than a minute with the ball.\n\nLions 6, Raiders 0\n\n8:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 Detroit was simply trying to draw the Raiders offsides. It didn't work. Riley Patterson's field goal is good, and the Lions extend their lead to six.\n\n8:56 p.m. \u2014 Raymond makes up some yardage on fourth down but comes up about eight yards short of the goal line. The Lions may be considering going for it...\n\n8:55 p.m. \u2014 The Lions are moving backwards after a holding call on Taylor Decker.\n\nEnd of first quarter: Lions 3, Raiders 0\n\n8:51 p.m. \u2014 Goff comes under heavy pressure on 3rd & 11 but finds a wide open Kalif Raymond for the first down. The Lions are into the red zone.\n\n8:49 p.m. \u2014 There's Amon-Ra St. Brown. Goff hits him on back-to-back plays for a total of 20 yards.\n\n8:47 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo's fourth down pass goes to no man's land after Hunter Renfrow falls down. The Lions will be set up not too far from field goal range.\n\n8:46 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders will go for it on 4th & 2 from about midfield...\n\n8:43 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders' defense rises to the challenge and forces a quick three-and-out. Detroit is punting for the first time tonight.\n\n8:38 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 And just like that... Jimmy Garoppolo turns it over. That can't happen. Kerby Joseph picks it off just in front of the end zone and gets the ball back to the Lions' offense two plays after the fumble.\n\n8:36 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 A big mistake from Josh Reynolds, who loses the ball after a catch and sees it quickly scooped up by the Raiders. It's Las Vegas ball deep in Lions territory.\n\n8:33 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo fights hard for the first down, using his legs and taking a big hit, but he comes up a yard short. The Raiders will punt.\n\n8:31 p.m. \u2014 A flag flies on the Raiders' first offensive snap, but it's picked back up as Josh Jacobs takes a pass 12 yards for a quick first down.\n\nLions 3, Raiders 0\n\n8:26 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Lions' running game stalls out, but not before they worked their way into field goal range. Riley Patterson drills one from 44 yards out to put Detroit in front early.\n\n8:22 p.m. \u2014 With Gibbs getting a breather, Craig Reynolds comes in and delivers a bruising 11-yard run. The Lions are bullying their way down the field.\n\n8:21 p.m. \u2014 Is this the Jahmyr Gibbs game? He already has six touches and just ran his way to another first down.\n\n8:19 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs picks up another Lions first down on a catch-and-run. He's heavily involved in the offense early on with David Montgomery out.\n\n8:18 p.m. \u2014 Goff hands off to Jahmyr Gibbs on the first two snaps of the night, and he hits Sam LaPorta on third down to convert. Nice start for the Lions' rookie class tonight.\n\n8:15 p.m. \u2014 The Lions will start with the ball, and we are underway!\n\n8:07 p.m. \u2014 As the broadcast points out, this is a homecoming for Michigan native Maxx Crosby. The play of him and fellow Michigan native Aidan Hutchinson will be pivotal tonight.\n\n7:56 p.m. \u2014 Josh Jacobs hasn't averaged more than 3.6 yards per carry in a single game this season. Can he get going against a strong Lions run defense? It'll be tough to win without at least some production from the former first-rounder.\n\n7:40 p.m. \u2014 On that note...
