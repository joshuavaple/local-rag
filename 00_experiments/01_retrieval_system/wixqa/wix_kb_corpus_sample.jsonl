If you prefer to manage the domain registration and payments at Wix, you can transfer your domain to Wix.\u00a0Learn more about transferring vs connecting your domain to Wix to find out which is best for you.\u00a0Important:\nYou must first upgrade your site to connect or transfer a domain. You'll need access to your current domain registrar before you connect or transfer a domain. The registrar is the company that hosts your domain. If you don't know who your domain registrar is, you can find out by visiting whois.com and entering your domain name to see your domain details.\u00a0Connecting a domain to your siteConnecting your domain to Wix (also known as \u201cdomain mapping\u201d) means that the domain management stays with your current domain host, but the URL of your domain connects to your Wix site. When people type your domain's web address (e.g. www.mywebsite.com) they are brought to your Wix site.\u00a0There are two ways in which you can connect your domain to Wix - via name servers or via pointing. The method you use to connect your domain determines where the DNS records of your domain are hosted. DNS (Domain Name System) records tell your domain where to go to load your website.\u00a0If you want to connect a domain you already own to your Wix account, we strongly recommend you do so by changing its name servers.Name servers vs. pointing:Learn more about the differences between connecting your domain by name servers vs. pointing.Connecting via nameservers (recommended method)With the name server connection method, Wix hosts your DNS records, while your domain remains registered with its current host. This means you continue to pay for domain registration with your current domain host (not Wix).\u00a0Follow our steps to connect your domain to the Wix name servers.If you'd like, you can transfer your domain to Wix to host your domain with us. You would then pay Wix for the domain's registration.\u00a0Connecting via pointingBy connecting via the pointing method, your DNS records are hosted outside of Wix. We do not recommend pointing because we're unable to assist you with issues that may arise in another DNS host's account. However, if your domain has complicated DNS records that you prefer not to reconfigure, pointing may be your best option.\u00a0Learn how to connect your domain via the pointing method.\u00a0Transferring a domain to WixIf you\u2019ve already purchased a domain from another provider, you can transfer the domain from its current registrar to Wix. This allows you manage your domain's registration, payments, contact info, and DNS records at Wix. Before transferring, make sure your domain is eligible to be transferred.\u00a0Tip:Most yearly Premium and Studio plans offer a 1 year free domain voucher. You can use the voucher to claim a new domain, or get 1 year of free registration when you transfer your domain to Wix.Connecting secondary domains to your siteYour primary domain is usually the domain name you choose when you first purchase your domain from Wix. You can choose a different\u00a0domain as your primary domain, but you can only have one primary domain.Secondary domains redirect to your primary domain.\u00a0You can easily connect an unlimited number of secondary domains to a single Wix site.\u00a0If you're connecting an additional domain that was purchased elsewhere, first connect the domain in your account. Once connected, set up the domain to redirect to your primary domain.\u00a0Learn more about connecting multiple domains to your Wix site.Connecting subdomains to your siteA subdomain is a prefix that appears before your primary or root domain. For example, \"shop.mysite.com\" is a subdomain of the root domain \"mysite.com\". \u00a0You can connect subdomains in your Wix account. For example, if you own the root domain mystunningwebsite.com, you can connect blog.mystunningwebsite.com to your blog website. Read our subdomains overview for more information.\u00a0Learn how to connect a subdomain to your primary domain.What's next?Make it easier for people to contact you.

After connecting your domain, these new records can take up to 48 hours to propagate. During this time, you may notice your site not loading, loading inconsistently, or loading a message which says 'Not Secure'. Learn more about domain propagation.\u00a0Domain transfers can take up to 7 days, which is why we recommend connecting your domain before transferring it to Wix.\u00a0If I connect my domain to Wix via name servers, where are my billing and contact details for my domain hosted?Billing and contact details are managed at your current domain host, not at Wix. Contact your existing domain host for assistance with domain renewals, contact information, and other domain-related billing inquiries.Can I switch to a different connection method even if I've already started connecting my domain? Yes. You can change the connection method for your domain at any time by removing and re-adding the domain to your Wix account.
